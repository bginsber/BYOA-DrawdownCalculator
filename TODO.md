TODO

Refine Input Validation:
Enforce stricter validation for percentage inputs (0-99.99%).
Provide more informative error messages for invalid inputs.
Enhance Visualization:
Explore alternative chart types or libraries for a more visually appealing and informative display.
Consider adding interactive elements to the chart (e.g., tooltips, zoom).
Implement ATH Recovery Path:
Add input fields for "All-Time High Price" and "Current Price."
Calculate the percentage gain required to recover to the all-time high.
Modify the visualization to display two recovery paths:
Recovery to the initial investment.
Recovery to the all-time high.
Improve UI/UX:
Ensure clear labeling and logical placement of new input fields.
Use visual cues to differentiate between the two recovery paths in the visualization.
Maintain a clean and intuitive interface.
Testing and Refinement:
Conduct thorough testing to ensure the accuracy of calculations and visualizations.
Gather user feedback and iterate on the design and functionality based on feedback.
