# Investment Drawdown Calculator

This interactive calculator helps investors visualize how portfolio losses impact the gains needed to return to their original investment value. Built during Nat's "Build Your Own Apps" course. 

## 📈 Why This Matters

Understanding the asymmetric nature of investment losses is crucial for risk management. For example:
- A 20% loss requires a 25% gain to recover
- A 50% loss requires a 100% gain to recover
- A 90% loss requires a 900% gain to recover
